# Do-Not-Play-Twice Maker  
A script that merges two ogg files into one to make a "DO NOT PLAY THIS AUDIO FILE TWICE" discord thing.  
This was made possible thanks to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F_fIlNYfPQ  

### Usage  
Replace `1.ogg` and `2.ogg` with the audio files of your choice and run `dnpt_maker.py`  
In case you're a beginner and you don't know what any of this means, proceed to the next part.

### For beginners  
1. Download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/  
2. Run the installer, check "Add Python to PATH" then click "Install Now".  
3. Once the installation finishes, you can close the setup.  
4. Just to make sure that the installation was successful, open CMD and enter `python --version`.  
5. If Python is installed, then you're ready to follow the usage above.
